## About me
- I cohautored [skglm](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a fast modular solver for sparse generalized linear models in high-dimension
- I work as a Data Scientist at Owkin, a biomedical AI startup
- Previously, I worked as a research scientist at INRIA
- I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris with a double major in data science and management


## Some personal projects
- [sparseglm](https://github.com/PABannier/sparseglm), a fast coordinate descent solver in Rust
- [nanograd](https://github.com/PABannier/nanograd), a lightweight deep learning framework built around Numpy arrays
