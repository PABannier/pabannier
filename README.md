### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a machine learning scientist at AI techbio [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/). ðŸ§¬

- ðŸ§¬ I co-created HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell detection, segmentation, and classification on histopathology slides.
- ðŸ“ˆ I co-developed [skglm](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm) (published at [NeurIPS](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/fe5c31e525e9a26a1426ab0b589f42fe-Abstract-Conference.html)), a fast solver for sparse optimization problems â€” used in production by energy companies and hedge funds for demand forecasting and market prediction.
- ðŸ”Š I built [bark.cpp](https://github.com/PABannier/bark.cpp), a C++ adaptation of the Bark TTS model using `ggml`, now powering several startupsâ€™ text-to-speech products.
- ðŸ§ª I [publish research](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=77JN6OcAAAAJ) in computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on applications in medical imaging.
- ðŸ“˜ I am writing [a book](https://github.com/) on building and optimizing your own keyâ€“value store in Rust.
