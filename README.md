## About me
- I work as a Data Scientist at AI biotech Owkin.
- Previously, I interned at [INRIA Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) on solving neuroscience (M/EEG) inverse problems.
- I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris with a double major in data science and management.

In 2022, I co-created [skglm](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a fast sklearn-compatible solver for sparse generalized linear models.
More recently, I've become interested in fast inference for large language models. I have implemented [Bark.cpp](https://github.com/PABannier/bark.cpp),
a port of SunoAI's Bark model in C/C++, as well as specialized models like [BioGPT.cpp](https://github.com/PABannier/biogpt.cpp).

## Cool open-source projects I contributed to

- [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python), a toolkit for exploring neurophysiological data in Python
- [Linfa](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa), the leading crate for machine learning and data analysis in Rust
- [Benchopt](https://github.com/benchopt/benchopt), a benchmarking suite for optimization algorithms

## Other projects I worked on
- [Encodec.cpp](https://github.com/PABannier/encodec.cpp), Meta's neural codec model ported in C++
- [SparseGLM](https://github.com/PABannier/sparseglm), a fast coordinate descent solver in Rust
- [Nanograd](https://github.com/PABannier/nanograd), a lightweight deep learning framework built around Numpy arrays
- [NarrateMate.ai](https://github.com/PABannier/NarrateMate.ai), a Next.JS web app to practice language comprehension listening to YouTube videos
