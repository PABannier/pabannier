## About me
- I work as a Data Scientist at Owkin, a biomedical AI startup. My research is focused on developing medical imaging techniques for histological slides and on spatial transcriptomics.
- Previously, I cohautored [skglm](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a fast modular solver for sparse generalized linear models in high-dimension.
- I worked as a research scientist at [INRIA Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) on solving neuroscience (M/EEG) inverse problems and optimization for sparse linear models.
- I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris with a double major in data science and management

## Some OSS projects I contributed to

- [skglm](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a fast sklearn-compatible solver for sparse generalized linear models
- [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python), a toolkit for exploring neurophysiological data in Python
- [linfa](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa), the leading crate for machine learning and data analysis in Rust
- [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), a JIT-compiler for Python scripts
- [benchopt](https://github.com/benchopt/benchopt), a benchmarking suite for optimization algorithms


## Some personal projects
- [sparseglm](https://github.com/PABannier/sparseglm), a fast coordinate descent solver in Rust
- [nanograd](https://github.com/PABannier/nanograd), a lightweight deep learning framework built around Numpy arrays
