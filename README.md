## About me
- I work as a Data Scientist at AI biotech [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/), working on digital pathology.
- I am also a software engineer and avid open-source contributor.
- Previously, I interned at [INRIA Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) on solving neuroscience (M/EEG) inverse problems.
- I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris with a double major in data science and management.

## Cool open-source projects I contributed to
